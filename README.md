## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Muhammed Sheded

ðŸš€ **AI Engineer | NLP & LLMs Enthusiast**

I am an AI Engineer with one year of experience. My expertise lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a strong focus on information retrieval, fine-tuning, and RAG pipelines.

### ðŸ”¬ **What I Do**
- **Fine-Tuning LLMs**: Proficient in LoRA & QLoRA techniques for test case generation from natural language requirements.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Skilled in building RAG pipelines using **Langchain** & **LlamaIndex** for private document interactions.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Hands-on experience with **Neo4j** and **Cypher** for self-learning systems.
- **Transformer Architectures**: Strong grasp of **BERT, GPT, Llama, T5**, and their applications.
- **Information Retrieval**: Expertise in **Sparse, Dense, and Hybrid retrieval** techniques.
- **Vector Databases**: Experienced with **Pinecone, Qdrant, FAISS, Chroma**.
- **Semantic Searching**: Skilled in **HNSW, Siamese architectures (bi-encoder, SBERT)**.
- **RAG Evaluation**: Assessing pipelines using **RAG Triad evaluation** (context relevance, answer relevance, groundedness).
- **Prompt Engineering**: Chain of Thought (**CoT**), **ReAct**, **Self-ask** and building agents.
- **Foundational Knowledge**: Deep understanding of **RNNs, LSTMs**, and transformer pre-training & fine-tuning.

### ðŸ“š **Continuous Learning**
Currently working on **Multimodal LLMs** and more advanced **agentic workflows**.
I stay updated with the latest AI & NLP advancements and enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge research.
